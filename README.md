# Cash-Register

This program utilizes Object Oriented Programming to make a cash register program. It keeps track of its denominations in bills and coins. The user may choose to either "Checkout", where they are charged an amount of money and the program will update the register accordingly, or they can choose to "Add Money", where the user chooses an amount of money to add to the register. The register also automatically adds money when a certain denomitaion is empty.
